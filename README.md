<h1> CPP-ASSIGNMENT</h1>

<h2>C++ PROGRAMS</h2>

<p>The theoretical study of object oriented programming in c++ has helped us understand what the language can help us for real life use.</p>

<p>But to practice that, it is important to brings its practical aspect into the curriculum.
So these practical programs of c++ have helped me and other begineers to understand how we can put what we have learnt into use.</p>

<p>Here all programs are simple demonstrations.</p>

<p>I would like to thanks <b>Mr. Naveen Dogra sir</b> for always guiding me in the same.</p>
